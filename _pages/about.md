Hello, my name is Ke Li (Chloé). I am a PhD student at INSEAD Europe Campus. I obtained my bachelor in Computer Science and Engineering from Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. During my undergraduate, I was advised by two amazing supervisors Baoxiang Wang and Yang Li (Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute). Before joining INSEAD, I worked at Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI) where I was fortunate to be advised by Zongqing Lu.

My current research interests in reinforcement learning and machine learning generally span two lines:

- Studying decision-making problems in dynamic and strategic environments, and their applications

- Improving machine learning for complex real-world data (e.g., graphs, rankings, partially observed data), under different contexts (e.g., distribution shift), in terms of various metrics (e.g., accuracy, efficiency, robustness, fairness)

The long-term goal of my research is to build a common framework for decision-making under different forms of uncertainty with strong guarantees on performance, robustness, and interpretability, striving for theoretically-elegant and practically-relevant research in the broad area of “AI + Systems + Decision Science.”
