Hello, my name is Ke Li (Chloe). I am currently a PhD student in Decision Science at INSEAD France Campus, advised by two amazing professors [Spyros Zoumpoulis](https://www.insead.edu/faculty/spyros-zoumpoulis) and [Georgina Hall](https://sites.google.com/view/georgina-hall). I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. During my undergraduate studies, I was very fortunate to work with and receive invaluable research guidance from [Baoxiang Wang](https://bxiangwang.github.io/) (CUHK-Shenzhen) and [Yang Li](http://yangli-feasibility.com/home/) (Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute).

Before my PhD, I worked as a reinforcement learning researcher at Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence ([BAAI](https://www.baai.ac.cn/english.html)) where I worked with [Zongqing Lu](https://z0ngqing.github.io/) on reinforcement learning and game AI. I also did ML internships at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/), [Byte Dance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/), and [Sense Time](https://www.sensetime.com/en) respectively during my undergraduate.

My current research interests generally span two lines:

- Information Design in Operations Research

- Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making 

- Human-AI Collaboration

The long-term goal of my research is to build a common framework for decision-making under different forms of uncertainty with strong guarantees on performance, robustness, and interpretability, striving for theoretically-elegant and practically-relevant research in the broad area of “Human + AI + Decision Science”.
