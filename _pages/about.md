Hello, my name is Ke Li (Chloe). I am currently a first-year PhD student at INSEAD advised by professors [Spyros Zoumpoulis](https://www.insead.edu/faculty/spyros-zoumpoulis). I obtained my bachelor in Computer Science and Engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. During my undergraduate, I was very fortunate to learn how to do research from professors [Yang Li](http://yangli-feasibility.com/home/) (Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute) and [Baoxiang Wang](https://bxiangwang.github.io/) (CUHK-Shenzhen). 

Before joining INSEAD, I worked as a reinforcement learning researcher at Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence where I worked with Prof. [Zongqing Lu](https://z0ngqing.github.io/) (Peking University) on Game AI. I also did several algorithm internships at Microsoft Research Asia, Byte Dance, and Sense Time during my undergraduate.

My current research interests in reinforcement learning and machine learning generally span two lines:

- Operations Management and Reinforcement Learning

- Decision-Making Problems in Dynamic and Strategic Environments

The long-term goal of my research is to build a common framework for decision-making under different forms of uncertainty with strong guarantees on performance, robustness, and interpretability, striving for theoretically-elegant and practically-relevant research in the broad area of “AI + Systems + Decision Science”.
